    <h2>Giving back to the open-source community</h2>

    <p class="catch">
      Turn relies heavily on field-proven, open-source software in all the
      layers of our technology stack. From Linux-based servers to the many
      open-source Java libraries our software uses, open-source software plays
      a crucial role in Turn's success. This is why we now give back to the
      community by making public some of our in-house developments under free
      and open-source software licenses.

    <h3><a href="http://turn.github.com/ttorrent/">Ttorrent</a></h3>

    <p>
      Turn's BitTorrent library, <a
        href="http://turn.github.com/ttorrent">ttorrent</a>, is an open-source,
      pure-Java implementation of the BitTorrent protocol, providing an
      easy-to-embed implementation with a BitTorrent tracker and a
      downloading/seeding client. Both the tracker and the clients provide
      hooks for easy integration in a larger application, allowing for tracker
      control, or download progression updates, for example.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ttorrent has been showing very exciting results in terms of global
      distribution speed and minimal overhead for the initial seeder. Since
      its first release, ttorrent has received several contributions from
      members of the open-source community and has been deployed at <a
        href="http://etsy.com">Etsy</a> as a means of distributing their Solr
      indexes (see <a
        href="http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/01/23/solr-bittorrent-index-replication/">Turbocharging
        Solr Index Replication with BitTorrent</a>).

    <h3><a href="http://queenjs.com/">Queen</a></h3>

    <p>
      Queen is a platform for running scripts on many browsers. It's a HTTP server
      which is capable of brokering socketed communication between browsers which
      are connected to it and other applications or scripts. The Queen server can
      be thought of as a pool of browsers which you can execute any JavaScript/HTML
      on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen comes with a RPC server for its thin-client, <a href="https://github.com/turn/queen-remote">queen-remote</a>
      allowing remote machines to execute code through Queen. The server can also 
      populate its connection automatically by spawn browsers using <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.browserstack.com/">Sauce Labs</a> or <a href="https://saucelabs.com/">BrowserStack</a>. 
      Execution can be targeted based on user-agent, or browser capabilities (anything 
      <a href="http://modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> can detect). Queen is the foundation
      of Thrill, our test runner.

    <h3><a href="http://thrilljs.com/">Thrill</a></h3>

    <p>
      Thrill is a test runner for web applications. It leverages the Queen server, 
      allowing many developers within an organization to use a central browser pool 
      to execute their tests on. Thrill is capable of automatically detecting and 
      injecting its adapter during testing to test suites using <a href="http://qunitjs.com/">QUnit</a>, 
      <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">jasmine</a>, <a href="http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/">mocha</a>, 
      or <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/">YUI</a>. This means minimal or no 
      configuration is necessary to run tests suites using these frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thrill can be run via command-line, grunt, or as an embedded library. It offers
      a simple API to write custom adapters or reporters, along with all the features
      of Queen.
